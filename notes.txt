Notes

- Add files to .gitignore at start of project
- Make sure key is dynamically / randomly generated and not present in the secret token file
- To set up testing, install guard and spork and configure the Guardfile so that running `guard` automatically 

- request specs correspond to integration tests and are more view-centric than controller or model tests?.. Clarify...
