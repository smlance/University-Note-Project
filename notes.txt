Notes

Remember: "Good artists copy. Great artists steal."

- Add files to .gitignore at start of project
- Make sure key is dynamically / randomly generated and not present in the secret token file
- To set up testing, install guard and spork and configure the Guardfile so that running `guard` automatically 

- request specs correspond to integration tests and are more view-centric than controller or model tests?.. Clarify...

- single-quoted strings treat everything except \' and \\ as literal characters. they do _not_ support interpolation:
	    >  puts 'hello #{john}'
	    => hello #{john}
